0) Square with colored fill
1) Circle Gradient

exported yellow breaker at 35 w x 90 h

	blue breaker at 50 w and 80 h

	green breaker at 39 x 95  


Ok, at some point I figured out that I could export the blocks at 168x168, then 
crop them at 120x120 in photoshop to drastically increase the quality

	Then I exported the red breaker at 108 x 178
	Then I exported teh blue breaker at 218 x 218 ?? Don't know why

exported red piece at 144x144 with deep plastic
yellow breaker was 56x145 with the deep plastic
red breaker was 89 x 146 i think, with deep plastic
blue breaker was 86 x 138 with deep plastic
