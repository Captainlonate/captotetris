captotetris
===========

Captotetris - A (soon to be) multiplayer tetris game with a competitive aspect. 
Based on puzzle pirates "swordfighting" puzzle game. 
There is no multiplayer yet, but it will be a no brainer. I just need some more time. 
All custom art ( not that it's exactly brilliant lol )

Here is a link to the latest playable version: <a href="http://captotetris.herokuapp.com/">Play!</a>
